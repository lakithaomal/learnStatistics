## Hypothesis Testing 
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It involves testing an assumption (called the null hypothesis) against an alternative claim (called the alternative hypothesis) to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the assumption.

### Null Hypothesis 
An assumption that treats everything equal or similar. 
	•	Null hypothesis (H₀): The default or initial assumption (e.g., “There is no effect” or “The means are equal”).
	•	Alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ): The claim you want to test (e.g., “There is an effect” or “The means are different”).

 Some Examples 
 	•	H_0: The new drug has no difference in effect compared to the standard.0
	•	H_1: The new drug has a greater effect than the standard.

 
| **Actual Situation**         | **Fail to Reject H₀**           | **Reject H₀**                     |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **H₀ is True**               | ✅ **Correct Decision**          | ❌ **Type I Error**              |
| **H₁ is True** (H₀ is False) | ❌ **Type II Error**             | ✅ **Correct Decision**          |

### P Value 
The P value is the probabilty of the null hypothesis being true. 

### Significance Level
  Common values: 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10. It represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s actually true (Type I error).
